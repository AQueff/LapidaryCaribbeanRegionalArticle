  abstract = {En la expresi\'on material de las sociedades prehisp\'anicas que habitaron la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), Colombia, durante los periodos cronol\'ogicos Nahuange (100\textendash 1000 dC) y Tairona (1000\textendash 1600 dC) se aprecia una amplia variedad de objetos elaborados en piedra verde. Entre estos se destacan placas aladas alargadas, posiblemente talladas con una intenci\'on simb\'olica asociada a un tipo de materia prima espec\'ifica. Placas aladas de formas similares se han reportado en amplias regiones del norte de Colombia y Venezuela, Panam\'a, Costa Rica y el Caribe. En este trabajo, la identificaci\'on de la materia prima a partir de estudios arqueom\'etricos realizados sobre placas aladas prehisp\'anicas de la SNSM revela que estas est\'an elaboradas en jade tipo nefrita, serpentinita y calcedonia. Las caracter\'isticas mineral\'ogicas de los artefactos fueron comparadas con la asociaci\'on mineral\'ogica identificada en rocas de la Formaci\'on Punta Bet\'in, la Formaci\'on Rodadero y el Batolito de Santa Marta de la Sierra Nevada. La similitud mineral\'ogica encontrada entre las placas y las rocas estudiadas permite proponer una fuente geol\'ogica de origen local en la SNSM., The artisanal record of the prehispanic peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), Colombia, who lived in the region during the chronological periods Nahuange (AD 100 to 1000) and Tairona (AD 1000 to 1600), contains a wide variety of artifacts made from varied materials. This is explained by the abundance of mineral resources in the area and existing cultural exchange with other regions. Many of these artifacts were made of a green stone, including winged plates carved for possibly symbolic reasons that were associated with a specific type of raw material. Winged plates with similar shapes have been archaeologically reported in the north of Colombia, Venezuela, Panam\'a, Costa Rica and the Caribbean. Archaeometric studies on the plates of the SNSM reveal that these are elaborated in nephrite, serpentinite, and chalcedony. The mineralogical characteristics identified in the artifacts were compared with the minerals identified on rocks of the Punta Bet\'in, Rodadero Formation, and the Batolito de Santa Marta of the Sierra Nevada. The mineralogical similarity found between the plates and the rocks allows us to suggest a geological source of local origin in the SNSM.},

Several models have been formulated to infer the structure of such archaeological networks. The applicability of these models in diverse archaeological contexts is limited by the restricted set of assumptions that fully determine the mathematical formulation of the models and are often articulated on a dyadic basis. Here, we present a general framework in which we combine exponential random graph models with archaeological substantiations of mechanisms that may be responsible for network formation. This framework may be applied to infer the structure of ancient networks in a large variety of archaeological settings. We use data collected over a set of sites in the Caribbean during the period AD 100\textendash 400 to illustrate the steps to obtain a network reconstruction.},

In Misliya Cave, Israel, dated to 240\textendash 160 ka BP, Glycymeris shells were found that were neither perforated nor manipulated; nevertheless, transportation to the cave is regarded as symbolic. In about 120 ka BP at Qafzeh Cave, Israel, modern humans collected naturally perforated Glycymeris shells also for symbolic use. Use-wear analyses backed by experiments demonstrate that the Qafzeh shells were suspended on string, thus suggesting that the collection of perforated shells was intentional. The older Misliya shells join a similar finding from South Africa, while the later-dated perforated shells from Qafzeh resemble other assemblages from North Africa and the Levant, also dated to about 120 ka BP. We conclude that between 160 ka BP and 120 ka BP there was a shift from collecting complete valves to perforated ones, which reflects both the desire and the technological ability to suspend shell beads on string to be displayed on the human body.},

  abstract = {This review aims to expose the potential of formal network methods for archaeology by tracing the origins of the academic traditions, network models, and techniques that have been most influential to archaeologists. A brief discussion of graph theoretic applications in archaeology reveals how graph visualization and analysis was used since the 1960s in a very similar way to later network analysis applications, but did not seem to have influenced the more widespread adoption of network techniques over the past decade. These recent archaeological applications have been strongly influenced by two academic traditions, social network analysis and sociophysics. The most influential and promising techniques and models adopted from these traditions are critically discussed. This review reveals some general trends which are considered to be the result of two critical issues that will need to be addressed in future archaeological network analysis: (1) a general unawareness of the historicity and diversity of formal network methods both within and outside the archaeological discipline has resulted in a very limited methodological scope; (2) the adoption or development of network methods has very rarely been driven by specific archaeological research questions and is dominated by a few popular models and techniques, which has in some cases resulted in a routinized explanatory process. This review illustrates, however, the great potential of formal network methods for archaeology and argues that, if this potential is to be applied in a critical way, a broad multidisciplinary scope is necessary and specific archaeological research contexts should dominate applications.},

Recent studies have identified changes in bead types and manufacturing methods over time, as well as evidence for possible local production. In order to understand the broader implications of these developments, geochemical analysis using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was undertaken on 73 beads from 10 Iron Age sites in Cambodia and Thailand and 64 geologic samples from four sites in India, Iran, and Thailand. The results show that many of the beads were produced from raw material derived from the Deccan Traps, India and that there is not yet strong evidence for bead production using a Southeast Asian source. Secondly, we find that there is not yet clear evidence for a change in the different geologic sources used to produce beads over time. This study adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the utility of LA-ICP-MS in differentiating and assigning provenience to agate/carnelian and other silicates.},

One, Arie Boomert (1987) has included the West Indies with Lowland South America in a model of "green stone" exchange, but reconstruction of exchange networks should not be limited to just one of the possible goods that may have circulated through it (Hirth 1984:2). This paper presents the geographical and temporal distributions of eleven "exotic" The term "exotic" is defined here as an object of non-local origin. When it is applied to an artifact made of rock or mineral, it means that the lithic source is not local; the place of manufacture is irrelevant in this use of the definition, stone artifact types in the Lesser Antilles and northeastern South America. It represents an attempt to place into a regional context the evidence for importation of exotics and for specialization in ornament production at the Saladoid site of Pearls, Grenada (see also Cody 1990a, 1990b). Although the study is limited to imported rocks and minerals, it provides a framework within which future studies can consider exports from particular sites, and also the possible roles pf pottery, foodstuffs, and other organics in exchange.}

  abstract = {As the southernmost island of the Lesser Antilles, Grenada would have been the first reached during the rapid movement of Saladoid peoples from mainland South America through the West Indies. It is possible that, at least initially, Grenada's population density was greater than reached on more distant islands, and it is likely that Grenada's location only 90 miles north of Venezuela enabled the early colonizers to maintain close contacts with the mainland. In the archaeological record, contacts between Grenada and the mainland should be expressed by the presence of "exotic" artifacts on the island. The sources of such artifacts and the dates of their manufacture can provide clues concerning the trading relationships, origins,! and development of prehistoric Antillean cultures. The site of Pearls (Gren-A-1) was first excavated by Ripley Bullen, who concluded that its Saladoid pottery belonged to "the earliest ceramic period of Grenada" (1964: 22). The site originally covered at least 25 acres (op cit: 18), but has since been disturbed by construction of the airport, and more recently by removal of rich midden for agricultural purposes and by looting. The looters have been finding artifacts made of a "green stone". Controlled test excavations conducted in August of 1988 and January of 1989 revealed numerous other exotic lithics as well, none of which are mentioned by Bullen in his 1964 report. After briefly describing the test excavations and the geology of Grenada, this paper will list the exotic lithics recovered form the site of Pearls. "Exotics" are considered to be those rocks or minerals of non-local origin. Possible geologic sources of some artifacts will be discussed, but space limitations preclude an examination of all ethnographic references and archaeological reports concerning the rock and mineral types. Additionally, radiocarbon dates associated with diagnostic vessels and sherds will be given, leading to the first absolute dates for the Saladoid colonization of Grenada. Finally, the cultural implications of the exotic artifacts at Pearls will be reviewed briefly. This pape}

This article advocates in favor of a greater dialogue between these two fields, not just at the level of methodology but also of theory. Relational thinking, which lies at the heart of network science, can shed light on key issues in island archeology, such as isolation/connectivity and centrality/marginality, and their effects on island communities. Island identities in particular are often considered fairly statically by archeologists, in terms of cultural divergence resulting from marginality and isolation. Given the range of population mobility and maritime interaction in the Mediterranean during the Neolithic and Bronze Age, a network perspective can cast a different light on insularity, focusing the attention on intercultural encounters and the role of marginal spaces in the development of relational identities.},

Here, we reassess personal ornaments found at Zhoukoudian Upper Cave and compare them with those from other Late Paleolithic Northern Chinese sites. We reappraise the information provided by Pei Wen Chung on Upper Cave personal ornaments lost during World War II and analyze casts of 17 of them, along with two unpublished objects displayed at the Zhoukoudian Site Museum and three original perforated teeth rediscovered at the Zhoukoudian Site Museum. We apply archeozoological, technological and use-wear analyses to document variation in ornamental practices and their change throughout the site stratigraphy. Badger, fox, red deer, sika deer, marten, and tiger teeth as well as carp bone, bird bone, Anadara shell, limestone beads, and perforated pebble appear to have been the preferred objects used as ornaments by Upper Cave visitors. Multivariate analysis of technological data highlights a correspondence between cultural layers and perforation techniques, with radial incising being typical of layer L2 and bidirectional incising of L4. The three rediscovered badger canines display features suggesting they were sewed on clothing rather than suspended from necklaces or bracelets. Elemental scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectromety and mineralogical ({$\mu$}-Raman) analyses of red residues adhering to the rediscovered teeth indicate these objects were originally coated with ochre and identify variations that match differences in technology. The two ornaments exhibited at the Zhoukoudian Site Museum are ancient teeth that were recently perforated and should be excluded from the Upper Cave assemblage. A seriation of Late Paleolithic ornaments found at Northern Chinese sites identifies a clear-cut difference in preferred ornament types between western and eastern sites, interpreted as reflecting two long-lasting traditions in garment symbolic codes.},

Our goal is to encourage archaeologists to formulate prehistoric research that draws on historical materialism, the Marxist reasoning for understanding political economy. Three prehistoric cases from the Pacific (Lapita, Vanuatu, and Hawai`i) help us evaluate the steps required to do this. Most importantly, we identify economic bottlenecks (constriction points) based on property rights for land or on production and trade of prestige goods. Resources can be mobilized by emergent elites at such bottlenecks to support strategies that enmesh land managers, captains, warriors, and priests to centralize power. A political economy approach in prehistory can help explain striking parallels observed for independent sequences as well as conjunctures and divergences in specific world culture areas.},

The site was an important node in long-distance interaction networks at play between circum-Caribbean communities during the first centuries of the Common Era. Pearls was an amethyst bead-making workshop and a gateway to South America, from where certain lapidary raw materials likely originated. The importance of the site for regional archaeology and local stakeholders cannot be overstated. However, it has undergone severe destruction and looting over the decades. Here, we present a study of a private collection of ornaments from Pearls, which combines raw material identification, typo-technological analysis and microwear analysis. We identify great diversity in lithologies and in techniques adapted to their working properties. Multiple abrasive techniques for sawing, grinding, polishing and carving are identified. Furthermore, the use of ornaments is examined for the first time. Finally, we contrast our dataset to other Antillean sites and propose management patterns for each raw material. Our approach ultimately provides new insights on ornament making at Pearls and on its role in regional networks.},

  abstract = {Humans settled the Caribbean about 6,000~years ago, and ceramic use and intensified agriculture mark a shift from the Archaic to the Ceramic Age at around 2,500~years ago1\textendash 3. Here we report genome-wide data from 174~ancient individuals from The Bahamas, Haiti and the Dominican Republic (collectively, Hispaniola), Puerto Rico, Cura\c{c}ao and Venezuela, which we co-analysed with 89~previously published ancient individuals. Stone-tool-using Caribbean people, who first entered the Caribbean during the Archaic Age, derive from a deeply divergent population that is closest to Central and northern South American~individuals; contrary to previous work4, we find no support for ancestry contributed by a population related to North American~individuals. Archaic-related lineages were {$>$}98\% replaced by a genetically homogeneous ceramic-using population related to speakers of languages in the Arawak family from northeast South America; these people moved through the Lesser Antilles and into the Greater Antilles at least 1,700~years ago, introducing ancestry that is still present. Ancient Caribbean people avoided close kin unions despite limited mate pools that reflect small effective population sizes, which we estimate to be a minimum of 500\textendash 1,500 and a maximum of 1,530\textendash 8,150 individuals on the combined islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the dozens of generations before the individuals who we analysed lived. Census sizes are unlikely to be more than tenfold larger than effective population sizes, so previous pan-Caribbean estimates of hundreds of thousands of people are too large5,6. Confirming a small and interconnected Ceramic Age population7, we detect 19~pairs of cross-island cousins, close relatives buried~around 75~km apart in Hispaniola and low genetic differentiation across islands. Genetic continuity across transitions in pottery styles reveals that cultural changes during the Ceramic Age were not driven by migration of genetically differentiated groups from the mainland, but instead reflected interactions within an interconnected Caribbean world1,8.},

  abstract = {Scholars typically argue that cultural interaction between the West Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica and the European mainland took place through the Tuscan Archipelago, via such intermediary islands as Elba and Pianosa. This path is posited as the prime route in and out of these islands for both people and objects throughout prehistory largely due to the belief that early\textemdash pre-sail\textemdash seafarers would have wished to avoid more treacherous open-sea voyages. This article tests this hypothesis using social network analysis (SNA) to identify the strengths of inter-site relationships through time based on the relative proportions of West Mediterranean obsidian raw materials at 79 Neolithic sites dating from the sixth to fourth millennia BC. We argue that similar patterns of obsidian consumption reflect similar procurement mechanisms and the likelihood of more frequent interactions between the people of these communities. As such, it becomes possible to reconstruct the relationships that mediated the distribution of obsidian across the landscape. Contrary to previous interpretations highlighting the role of Elba and Pianosa in the exchange of obsidian from the geological sources of Sardinia along the coast to northern Italy and France, our results suggest that obsidian also took a more direct open-sea path upwards of 200 km from Corsica to the coastal regions of Provence and Languedoc in southern France. These results are contextualized within broader patterns of obsidian circulation and use and have important implications for debates surrounding Neolithic obsidian procurement, exchange spheres, and early maritime navigation.},

Carnelian beads in particular have long been held as a type marker of early contact across the Bay of Bengal, from the mid-late 1st millennium BC. With this paper we demonstrate, from the central-northern Myanmar settlement and cemetery sites of Oakaie and Nyaung'gan, not only the presence of semi-precious stone beads, but also their production during the Late Neolithic to Early-Mid Bronze Age, late 2nd millennium to early-mid 1st millennium BC. We employed the cha\^ine op\'eratoire technique to establish reliable links between the industrial and funerary evidence, as represented by 489 finished beads and a vast quantity of production debris. The sites in question are chronologically-overlapping and separated by only five kilometres, but such ornaments are found across the region and it is of fundamental importance to provide a solid foundation to expand semi-precious stone ornament studies and unravel the complex networks of social interactions that led to their exchange.},

At the forefront of these challenges are issues associated with the aggregation and fragmentation of archaeological data that influence the size, density, and confidence in network models. These methodological challenges are unfortunate, as the diverse roles of social networks among hunter-gatherers have long been recognized within anthropological research. In order to enhance the research potential of networks constructed from hunter-gatherer archaeological data, this research highlights two data evaluation methods established in social science research to assess the stability of network structure. More specifically, this research constructs network models from the compositional analysis of ceramic artifacts recovered in the Kuril Islands of northeast Asia and evaluates network centrality measures using bootstrap simulation and sensitivity analysis. Results of this research suggest that while archaeologists may never fully identify the ``true'' network of past relationships, network models that approximate ``true'' network structure can provide useful metrics in exploring the behavior of past hunter-gatherer populations. Overall, given the challenges associated with hunter-gatherer archaeological data, it is argued here that critically evaluating the structure and stability of network models is an essential first step in developing an archaeological network analysis that is relevant and informative to research on past small-scale societies.},

Though these islands were never isolated from the surrounding mainland, their histories are sufficiently diverse to warrant their identification as distinct areas of culture. Over the past 20 years, Caribbean archaeology has been transformed from a focus on reconstructing culture histories to one on the mobility and exchange expressed in cultural and social dynamics. This Handbook brings together, for the first time, examples of the best research conducted by scholars from across the globe to address the complexity of the Caribbean past. The Handbook is divided into five sections. Part I, Islands of History and the Precolonial History of the Caribbean Islands, provides an introduction to Caribbean Archaeology and its history. The papers in the following Ethnohistory section address the diversity of cultural practices expressed in the insular Caribbean and develop historical descriptions in concert with archaeological evidence in order to place language, social organization, and the native Ta\'inos and Island Caribs in perspective. The following section, Culture History, provides the latest research on specific geographical locations and cross-cultural engagements, from Jamaica and the Bahama archigelago to the Saladoid and the Isthmo-Antillean Engagements. Creating History, the fourth section, includes papers on specific issues related to the field, such as Zooarchaeology, Rock Art, and DNA analysis, among others. The final section, World History, centers on the consequences of European colonization.},

This paper seeks to highlight the multiscalar and material underpinnings of this process of global importance by tracing it to its roots: the earliest encounters between the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and European colonists. We present a database, based on key Spanish historical sources, which catalogs all references to the transaction of objects between Amerindians and Europeans from AD 1492\textendash 1497. We furthermore argue for the need of a framework that is able to connect, explore, and track the structural materiality of things in encounter events. For this we suggest a combination of entanglement theory with network and substantive analyses. This multiscalar theoretical and methodological framework shows how a diverse and contextually specific network of humans and things arose in tandem with European and Amerindian attempts to establish, manipulate, and contest ties of significant personal and historical interest.},

  abstract = {Dense and strong, hydrothermal-metasomatic jadeitite and jadeite-omphacite rocks were used as tools and adornments throughout the wider Caribbean since initial inhabitation. Regionally, rich sources of jadeitite and jadeite-omphacite jade are known only in Guatemala (north and south of the Motagua Fault Zone), eastern Cuba and the northern Dominican Republic, establishing that humans transported jadeitic material over vast distances. This study validates that geochemical fingerprinting is a viable provenance method for Caribbean pre-colonial jadeitic lithologies. An assemblage of 101 source rocks has been characterised for trace element and combined Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions. Four statistical approaches (Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding, Decision Tree, and Multiclass Regression) were assessed, employing source-distinct trace element ratios. A multiclass regression technique based on trace element ratios of immobile high field strength, light to medium rare earth and fluid-mobile, large-ion-lithophile elements is shown to be most effective in discriminating the four source regions. Ninety-one \% of the Guatemalan samples can be discriminated from the Dominican and Cuban sources using La/Th, Zr/Hf and Y/Th ratios. Jadeitic rocks cropping out in the Dominican Republic can be distinguished from Cuban jades employing Er/Yb, Nb/Ta and Ba/Rb ratios with 71\% certainty. Furthermore, the two Guatemala sources, north and south of the Motagua Fault Zone, can be discriminated by using (among others) Zr/Hf, Ta/Th, La/Sm and Dy/Y ratios with an 89\% success rate. This raises the possibility of determining, in detail, former trading and mobility networks between different islands and the Meso- and Central American mainland within the Greater Caribbean. The provenance technique was applied to 19 pre-colonial jade celts excavated from the Late Ceramic Age Playa Grande archaeological site in the northern Dominican Republic. Three artefacts are discriminated as derived from the Guatemalan source, indicating that, despite a source of jade within 25~km, material was traded from Guatemala. The presence of Guatemalan jade in the Playa Grande lithic assemblage provides further evidence of large scale ({$>$}3000~km), regional trading and indigenous knowledge transfer networks.},

  abstract = {This dissertation elucidates the lapidary technologies and social organisation of pre-Columbian Costa Rica (500 B.C. - A.D. 900), by analysing the manufacturing and social role of lapidary ornaments, known as celtiform pendants. Celtiform pendants are characterised by skilfully decorated carvings on celtiform semiprecious rocks and minerals. A human or animal face is carved on the poll of axe, while the bit is not decorated, leaving the edge of the axe. These pendants are interpreted as a symbol of status, and as prestigious objects; hence these sophisticated carved images require a large amount of time and efforts to carve. In order to approach the lapidary technologies, the author conducts material analyses at local museums by utilising a digital microscope, silicon casting, and technology Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI). Then, carving experiments and traceology analyses with metallographic microscope are executed in the University of Southampton.{$<$}br/{$>$}Through the results of material analyses and distribution of celtiform pendants, the productive organisation and social role of celtiform pendants are discussed. Particularly, this study concentrates on how the ancient technologies are learned, developed and diffused in pre-Columbian Costa Rica. The geographical-temporal distribution of celtiform pendants demonstrates that the Greater Nicoya region is key as a centre of lapidary production. For instance, the manufacturing technologies of and the variation in celtiform pendants concentrates in the Greater Nicoya region. This suggests that the production of celtiform pendants is centralised primarily in Greater Nicoya, and was distributed to other regions.{$<$}br/{$>$}The variability in working-costs and complexity of manufacturing process of celtiform pendants indicates that lapidary artisans with diverse skills and economic status were involved in their workshops. Although the ancient society of Costa Rica was formed by different social-cultural groups, in some extent, a social integration was achieved by the widely shared material cultures\textemdash{} celtiform pendants\textemdash. The productive organisation of celtiform pendants indicate that pre-Columbian Costa Rica during the Florescent Period (around A.D. 300 - 700) was highly developed, and it was a crucial period to form their society.},

  abstract = {La biodiversit\'e peut \^etre mesur\'ee de nombreuses fa\c{c}ons. La dualit\'e entropie-diversit\'e fournit un cadre clair et rigoureux pour le faire. L'entropie est la surprise moyenne fournie par les individus d'une communaut\'e. Le choix de la fonction d'information qui mesure cette surprise \`a partir des probabilit\'es d'occurence des esp\`eces (ou d'autres cat\'egories) permet de d\'efinir les mesures de diversit\'es neutres, fonctionnelles ou phylog\'en\'etique pr\'esent\'ees ici. L'entropie est transform\'ee en diversit\'e au sens strict par une fonction croissante (l'exponentielle d\'eform\'ee), ce qui simplifie son interpr\'etation en tant que nombre \'equivalent d'esp\`eces. L'entropie phylog\'en\'etique g\'en\'eralise les indices de diversit\'e classique, int\`egre si n\'ecessaire la distance entre esp\`eces, peut \^etre \'ecompos\'ee et corrig\'ee des biais d'estimation. Sa transformation en diversit\'e au sens strict permet d'interpr\'eter les valeurs sous une forme unique : un nombre \'equivalent d'esp\`eces et un nombre \'equivalent de communaut\'es. La diversit\'e de Leinster et Cobbold g\'en\'eralise \`a son tour la diversit\'e phylog\'en\'etique et permet d'autres d\'efinitions de la distance entre esp\`eces. Le param\'etrage des mesures (l'ordre de la diversit\'e) permet de donner plus ou moins d'importance aux esp\`eces rares et de tracer des profils de diversit\'e. La construction de ce cadre m\'ethodologique est pr\'esent\'ee en d\'etail ainsi que plusieurs approches diff\'erentes, qui constituent l'\'etat de l'art de la mesure de la biodiversit\'e.},

  abstract = {Humans evolved in a patchwork of semi-connected populations across Africa1,2; understanding when and how these groups connected is critical to interpreting our present-day biological and cultural diversity. Genetic analyses reveal that eastern and southern African lineages diverged sometime in the Pleistocene~epoch, approximately 350\textendash 70 thousand years ago (ka)3,4; however, little is known about the exact timing of these interactions, the cultural context of these exchanges or the mechanisms that drove their separation. Here we compare ostrich eggshell bead variations between eastern and southern Africa to explore population dynamics over the past 50,000~years. We found that ostrich eggshell bead technology probably originated in eastern Africa and spread southward approximately 50\textendash 33~ka via a regional network. This connection breaks down approximately 33~ka, with populations remaining isolated until herders entered southern Africa after 2~ka. The timing of this disconnection broadly corresponds with the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which caused periodic flooding of the Zambezi River catchment (an area that connects eastern and southern Africa). This suggests that climate exerted some influence in shaping human social contact. Our study implies a later regional divergence than predicted by genetic analyses, identifies an approximately 3,000-kilometre stylistic connection and offers important new insights into the social dimension of ancient interactions.},

  abstract = {The modern-day Caribbean is a stunningly diverse but also intricately interconnected geo-cultural region, resulting partly from the islands' shared colonial histories and an increasingly globalizing economy. Perhaps more importantly, before the encounter between the New and Old World took place, the indigenous societies and cultures of the pre-colonial Caribbean were already united in diversity. This work seeks to study the patterns of this pre-colonial homogeneity and diversity and uncover some of their underlying processes and dynamics. In contrast to earlier studies of its kind, this study adopts an archaeological network approach, in part derived from the network sciences. In archaeology, network approaches can be used to explore the complex relations between objects, sites or other archaeological features, and as such represents a powerful new tool for studying material culture systems. Archaeological research in general aims to uncover the social relations and human interactions underlying these material culture systems. Therefore, the interdependencies between social networks and material culture systems are another major focus of this study. This approach and theoretical framework is tested in four case studies dealing with lithic distribution networks, site assemblages as ego-networks, indigenous political networks, and the analysis of artefact styles in 2-mode networks. These were selected for their pertinence to key research themes in Caribbean archaeology, in particular the current debates about the nature of ties and interactions between culturally different communities in the region, and the structure and dynamics of pre-colonial socio-political organisation. The outcomes of these case studies show that archaeological network approaches can provide surprising new insights into longstanding questions about the patterns of pre-colonial connectivity in the region.},

In settling distant oceanic islands, populations developed new technology in response to local environments, but also shared selectively neutral aspects of artefact design. Building on the work of Sinoto and Allen, we examine proximal endpoint line-attachment-devices (LADs) in fishhook assemblages from East Polynesia to address issues of interaction and cultural sharing among island communities. We construct relational networks using artefact classes and employ a series of non-parametric randomisation tests to directly evaluate the influence of geographical distribution on assemblage similarity in a time-averaged dataset. The results support a model of cultural transmission through social interaction largely irrespective of geographical distance. Our results show the degree of cultural relatedness among various fishhook assemblages, and we consider some implications for human migrations in East Polynesia.},

  abstract = {Over the last several years, network methods and models from the social and physical sciences have gained considerable popularity in archaeology. Many of the most common network methods begin with the creation of binary networks where links among some set of actors are defined as either present or absent. In most archaeological cases, however, the presence or absence of a specific kind of relationship between actors is not straightforward as we must rely on material proxies for assessing connections. A common approach in recent studies has been to define some threshold for the presence of a tie by partitioning continuous relational data among sites (e.g., artifact frequency or similarity data). In this article, using an example from the U.S. Southwest, we present a sensitivity analysis focused on the potential effects of defining binary networks from continuous relational data. We show that many key network properties that are often afforded social interpretations are fundamentally influenced by the assumptions used to define connections. We suggest that, although network graphs provide powerful visualizations of network data, methods for creating and analyzing weighted (non-binarized) networks often provide a better characterization of specific network properties.},

  abstract = {The preventive excavation of an archaeological site located at the Gare Maritime of Basse-Terre (Guadeloupe, French West Indies) revealed a series of stone artifacts including finished beads and pendants, as well as pieces representing several stages of the cha\^ine op\'eratoire. This work is an integrated study of the mineralogy and typo-technology of these objects. The artifacts have been recovered from layers interpreted as midden deposits of an early Saladoid coastal settlement dated to 250\textendash 400 cal. A.D. Non-invasive analyses by Raman spectroscopy have shown that the 50 artifacts belong to 13 different gemstones which are, in decreasing order of frequency: serpentine, amethyst, turquoise, sudoite, rock crystal, calcite, feldspar, diorite, jasper, aventurine, chlorite, paragonite and nephrite. All these materials' mineralogy, and in particular the great diversity of the so called ``green rocks'', could only be reliably determined through an analytical characterization. The diversity of lithic materials used and abandoned in the Gare Maritime site dump is the largest known to date in the Caribbean archipelago. The presence of seven objects in turquoise is particularly noteworthy in view of its rarity in the other known sites in the region. The cha\^ine op\'eratoire for each of these raw materials could be approached for the first time in the Caribbean area by emancipating ourselves from the ``greenstone'' category, which has been too often used in the past because of the lack of reliable mineralogical identification. These results make it possible to integrate the Gare Maritime site into the group of Saladoid sites which have delivered a large set of ornamental elements. On the one hand, the various shapes of artifacts fit the regional cultural pattern, both for beads and pendants shapes, the latter being mainly stylized frogs. On the other hand, the use of 13 semi-precious stones in the lapidary production is exceptional for the region and confirms the use at this period of many exotic raw materials. The provenance of these materials, although difficult to pinpoint properly due to the incomplete mapping of regional resources, documents a mixture of regional and even distant (continental) origins, thus strengthening the idea of a pan-Caribbean network for the exchange of raw materials for lapidary art.},

  abstract = {The transition to farming is the process by which human groups switched from hunting and gathering wild resources to food production. Understanding how and to what extent the spreading of farming communities from the Near East had an impact on indigenous foraging populations in Europe has been the subject of lively debates for decades. Ethnographic and archaeological studies have shown that population replacement and admixture, trade, and long distance diffusion of cultural traits lead to detectable changes in symbolic codes expressed by associations of ornaments on the human body. Here we use personal ornaments to document changes in cultural geography during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. We submitted a binary matrix of 224 bead-types found at 212 European Mesolithic and 222 Early Neolithic stratigraphic units to a series of spatial and multivariate analyses. Our results reveal consistent diachronic and geographical trends in the use of personal ornaments during the Neolithisation. Adoption of novel bead-types combined with selective appropriation of old attires by incoming farmers is identified in Southern and Central Europe while cultural resistance leading to the nearly exclusive persistence of indigenous personal ornaments characterizes Northern Europe. We argue that this pattern reflects two distinct cultural trajectories with different potential for gene flow.},

The spread of Lapita out of an ancestral Asian homeland is a dominant narrative in the origins of Pacific peoples, and although Island New Guinea has long been recognized as a springboard for the peopling of Oceania, the role of Indigenous populations in this remarkable phase of exploration remains largely untested. Here, we report the earliest evidence for Lapita-introduced animals, turtle bone technology and repeated obsidian import in southern New Guinea 3,480\textendash 3,060\,years ago, synchronous with the establishment of the earliest known Lapita settlements 700\,km away. Our findings precede sustained Lapita migrations and pottery introductions by several centuries, occur alongside Indigenous technologies and suggest continued multicultural influences on population diversity despite language replacement. Our work shows that initial Lapita expansion throughout Island New Guinea was more expansive than previously considered, with Indigenous contact influencing migration pathways and island-hopping strategies that culminated in rapid and purposeful Pacific-wide settlement. Later Lapita dispersals through New Guinea were facilitated by earlier contact with Indigenous populations and profoundly influenced the region as a global centre of cultural and linguistic diversity.},

  abstract = {"Assemblage" is a fundamental archaeological construct. By their composition, we interpret assemblages as expressions of activity or cultural identity. Yet they are not simple products of these factors alone but also of formation processes. Assemblages accumulated over varying spans, with varying combinations of tool types and discard rates. They are contexts for the playing out of complex relationships, not static types. This is a materialist view, against the essentialist view that assemblages are exemplars of ideal types (e.g., "base camps," "Quina Mousterian"). Materialism implies that their size and composition, fundamental assemblage characteristics, are correlated variables, not fixed properties, and that composition varies as size increases. I document size dependence consistent with materialism in Paleoindian and Paleolithic assemblages. Among ways to analyze size-dependent assemblage data, I apply "SHE analysis"\textemdash the joint study of assemblage richness, heterogeneity, and evenness\textemdash to gauge data's fit to theoretical models. Archaeologists acknowledge size dependence, but we misapprehend it as a methodological bias of assemblage measures that must be suppressed when, in materialist perspective, it reveals meaningful relationships that an essentialist view cannot.          ,              Resumen             "Conjunto" es un concepto arqueol\'ogico fundamental.

  abstract = {By the beginning of the Western Zhou dynasty, China's nephrite-jade tradition has already undergone over two millennia of development from its regional Neolithic roots, translated and disseminated through the Shang. At the same time, increased contact with non-Zhou peoples brought their unconventional tastes, materials, and traditions from the north and west. While the former appeared as antique collectibles, imitations, or re-interpretations and new exploitations of older forms, the latter is manifest mainly in elaborate personal regalia that used both native and imported materials, techniques, designs and aesthetics. In this paper, using first-hand materials recovered from Zhou and non-Zhou elite burials, I conclude that their colorful material choices and personal regalia designs revealed complex cultural encounters with peripheral peoples that had a lasting impact on early Chinese artistic and ritual history, well beyond the short lifespan of the personal regalia. These early encounters enriched decorative traditions in later Zhou arts, and elicited reactions that were partly responsible for China's jade production to emerge from the clutches of bygone traditions to reach unprecedented heights by the end of the millennium.},

Lapita long-distance interactions occurred across some of the greatest distances found in Neolithic societies worldwide. But did they represent exchange, particularly of prestige goods, as in most narratives, or did they signal another form of interaction? The chapter extends the ideas discussed in several recent papers, including a key one by Tim Earle and the author of 2015. The Lapita phenomenon is foundational for much of the Western Pacific but it cannot be understood outside of a wider context addressing its ultimate origins and the subsequent societal transformations that occurred over the next thousand years. In part to address such questions of the longue duree, the chapter develops the idea of prestige practices as an alternative (or addition) to that of prestige goods. Prestige practices are those activities that enhance the sociopolitical status of an individual through the activation of often-esoteric knowledge systems and powers above and beyond the merely pragmatic skills used in the production of material items, transport systems or other communally recognised activities and/or performances. Although seemingly ephemeral in the archaeological record, this does not mean that traces of them cannot be found there.},

  abstract = {Ornaments (aka beads) are the most common and ubiquitous art form of the Late Pleistocene. This fact suggests a common, fundamental function somewhat different to other kinds of Paleolithic art. While the capacity for artistic expression could be considerably older than the record of preserved (durable) art would suggest, beads signal a novel development in the efficiency and flexibility of visual communication technology. The Upper Paleolithic was a period of considerable regional differentiation in material culture, yet there is remarkable consistency in the dominant shapes and sizes of Paleolithic beads over more than 25,000~years and across vast areas, even though they were made from diverse materials and, in the case of mollusc shells, diverse taxonomic families. Cultural and linguistic continuity cannot explain the meta-pattern. The evidence indicates that widespread adoption of beads of redundant form was not only about local and subregional communication of personal identity or group affinity, but also an expansion in the geographic scale of social networks. The conformity of the beads grew spontaneously and in a self-organizing manner from individuals' interest in tapping into the network as a means for spreading social and environmental risk.},

The origin of these beads is tested here, through a pioneering non-destructive geochemical sourcing study of carnelian beads and potential source material. Our results suggest that many of these beads do not derive from India. Instead, a complex multi-source origin, involving some local Southeast Asian manufacture, appears likely. This finding further erodes the already crumbling foundation of diffusion-based theories of Southeast Asian state development. An alternative, regionally focused, approach to the study of these beads is recommended using geochemical analysis to help trace their trade within Southeast Asia. This will enable a better understanding of their role in, and impact upon, existing prestige goods exchange networks within the region.}

Although extensive archaeological research has been conducted at the site, the refinement of its chronology is essential for two reasons: (1) to establish the chronological control necessary to characterize social processes diachronically and (2) to ensure that the occupational history of La Quemada is accurately integrated into the regional chronology of the northern frontier. A combination of frequency seriation, correspondence analysis, and discriminant function analysis results in the recognition of three occupational phases across the areas excavated by the La Quemada-Malpaso Valley Archaeological Project (LQ-MVAP). Our three-phase chronology independently confirms both the intra-context ordering of analytic units and the previously proposed growth trajectory of the site: beginning in the monumental core, expanding into the western flank, and later retracting back into the core. The separation of the LQ-MVAP material record into chronological phases means it is now possible to track changes in the social processes that may have contributed to the formation, maintenance, and decline of La Quemada and other northern frontier polities., Durante el Epicl\'asico (600\textendash 900 dC), la frontera septentrional de Mesoam\'erica consisti\'o en una red regional de grupos concentrados en sus respectivos centros ceremoniales, incluido el sitio de La Quemada, Zacatecas.

The aim of this paper is to review and assess 12 methods of diversity ordering and discuss their relationships in detail. Two of the methods are new to the ecological literature. The diversity ordering methods are compared as to their effectiveness in graphically displaying the differences of community structure and demonstrating the (non-)comparability of communities. Small, medium and large data sets were used to evaluate the methods. A small artificial data set (five to seven species) and a large semi-artificial data set (31 \textemdash{} 141 species) are used in this paper. The results suggest that R\'enyi's diversity index family and Logarithmic dominance ordering are the most useful methods for diversity ordering of communities of all sizes. Right-tailsum diversity ordering performs well for small communities.},

  abstract = {Our knowledge of the migration routes of the first anatomically modern populations colonising the European territory at the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic, of their degree of biological, linguistic, and cultural diversity, and of the nature of their contacts with local Neanderthals, is still vague. Ethnographic studies indicate that of the different components of the material culture that survive in the archaeological record, personal ornaments are among those that best reflect the ethno-linguistic diversity of human groups. The ethnic dimension of beadwork is conveyed through the use of distinct bead types as well as by particular combinations and arrangements on the body of bead types shared with one or more neighbouring groups. One would expect these variants to leave detectable traces in the archaeological record. To explore the potential of this approach, we recorded the occurrence of 157 bead types at 98 European Aurignacian sites. Seriation, correspondence, and GIS analyses of this database identify a definite cline sweeping counter-clockwise from the Northern Plains to the Eastern Alps via Western and Southern Europe through fourteen geographically cohesive sets of sites. The sets most distant from each other include Aurignacian sites from the Rh\^one valley, Italy, Greece and Austria on the one hand, and sites from Northern Europe, on the other. These two macro-sets do not share any bead types. Both are characterised by particular bead types and share personal ornaments with the intermediate macro-set, composed of sites from Western France, Spain, and Southern France. We argue that this pattern, which is not explained by chronological differences between sites or by differences in raw material availability, reflects the ethnolinguistic diversity of the earliest Upper Palaeolithic populations of Europe.},

The Mabaruma and Hertenrits cultures stand apart from these because they made earthen mounds on which they built villages near their raised fields.

  abstract = {Burials provide valuable information to study social structures based on the assumption that burials and associated grave goods can represent social roles and relations in a society. To study social relationships, network analysis has been increasingly applied to archaeological data to infer interactions and relationships between entities. Statistical approaches to network analysis, such as exponential random graph models (ERGMs), provide a way to test hypotheses about dynamic processes of network formation. However, computational difficulties and sensitivity to uncertainties limit the application of ERGMs. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework on ERGMs that enables an efficient computational process, effective quantification of uncertainty, and robust model evaluation of network properties. We tested a hypothesis of social change relative to the arrival of Europeans by studying burial data from Kiwulan, an Iron Age site in northeastern Taiwan. The results indicate a transition among the burials from network ties based on ritual objects to wealth objects, and a more centralized structure with increased social differentiation after the European presence was established in the 17th century. Our case study demonstrates the effectiveness of Bayesian network analysis for archaeological data, and expands the use of burials in understanding the impacts of colonial presence on Indigenous groups in a pericolonial context.},
